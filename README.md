If you frequent the Obsidian discord server, you may have seen this image in the Canvas Showcase channel:

I got a lot more interest than I expected over that, so to simplify things, I went ahead and cleaned up the template vault I had lying around to upload as a sample vault. You're free to download and mess around with it as you please, but I want to _strongly_ emphasize that I am not a coder. All of the snippets were made via ChatGPT and Claude, so if you need any troubleshooting or want more features, I honestly may not be able to help you. Thanks for understanding, and I hope you enjoy!
