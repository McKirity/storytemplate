This is a sample vault I set up after someone requested it. While I only left only the necessary plugins behind, I want to specify that A) this was originally tailored to my workflow, so a lot of things may not gel with you (such as hotkeys and certain setting preferences), and B) I am ***NOT*** a coder. This was all achieved by arguing back and forth with ChatGPT and Claude AI. If you need troubleshooting or want additional features, I honestly may not be able to help you. This was also made using the Dataview plugin rather than the new Datacore, as there simply wasn't enough documentation for me to work with and I am ***NOT*** able to migrate it over. Please keep that in mind as you peruse this vault. 

That being said, I do have instructions for hopefully all the critical snippets (I definitely missed a few, sorry) in [[Snippet Compendium]].
# Story
- Use Ctrl + N to bring up the QuickAdd Menu. 
- Select **Tale** to populate a novel inside of [[Story/Story|Story]], including all template files
- Select **Chapter** to populate chapters inside of the **Tale**, only numerical values are possible (and if you want anything else, you're just gonna have to put in the body of the note bc otherwise it will break the hell out of a lot of scripts lmao). Template files will also be populated.
- Select **Scene** to populate scenes inside of **Chapters,** DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE FILE PATH INSIDE OF QUICKADD.
# Wiki
- Same deal, Ctrl + N to open QuickAdd menu and open up the Wiki drop down, select which on you want to populate with. 

# Statistics
- Fun side thing that tracks your statistics in Story and Wiki. 
- 'Prose words' means actual text inside the text body (no frontmatter) of specific notes
